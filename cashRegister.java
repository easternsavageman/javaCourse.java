// Write a cash register class. It should have the following methods:
// AddTransaction(amount) – add an amount to a running total and increments the number of transactions
// TransactionCount( ) – returns the number of transactions received
// Total( ) – returns the sum of the amounts of the transactions
// ResetTransactions( ) – sets the total amount and transaction count to 0
// Register Count( ) – returns the number of cash registers created
// Next, write an application that instantiates at least two cash register objects to prove that your class works.
// P.S.: Don't worry about storing each individual transaction, and we are dealing only with totals. No need to handle individual orders/items per transaction


public class cashRegister {
    
public static void main(String[] argv)   
{ 
    // String stringReversed = reverse("perpendicular"); 
    // System.out.println(stringReversed);
}  
}
