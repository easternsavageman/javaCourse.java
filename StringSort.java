/* Complete the following programming assignment and submit your code (.java)  by uploading the file(s).

Write a program that sorts Strings. 
The program should prompt the user for the number of Strings to read, 
and then read the Strings from standard input one at a time. 
Then it should sort the Strings into alphabetical order using any sorting algorithm with which you are familiar, 
and print them to the console. 
The commentary material on console I/O, arrays, and the String.compareTo() method should all be useful, 
so be sure to read the commentary! 
Do not use any classes in the java.util package; 
specifically, do not use java.util.Arrays or java.util.Vector. */


public class StringSort {
    // How many strings do you want to read
    // read strings one at a time from input
    // sort the strings alphabetically
}
